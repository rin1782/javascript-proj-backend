This is a rails API created with fast json serializers

This restful API will connect with a frontend vanilla JavaScript frontend to display a user's children to sort out their daily chores.

There are two model classes: Kid and Chore. Chores belong to the kids and a kid has many chores.

The frontend will make multiple AJAX calls to the API to grab information about the children's pre-seeded chores. 

Currently, a user is able to Read all of and then Delete the children's chores as they finish. 

Eventually I will add methods in the chore's controller to also be able to Create and Update to round out the CRUD operations.
